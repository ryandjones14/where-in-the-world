# Where in the World?

## what in the world?
a simple game where you are shown a random picture from Unsplash and you have to guess which country the picture was taken in.

## how in the world?
i made this game using the [Unsplash.com](http://unsplash.com) api and react. this is one of the first things i've built on my own in react so i probably broke some "rules" but plan on coming back (but who knows?) to clean up some of it as i continue developing this.

## what's next in the world (for Where in the Word)?
Here's my [trello board](https://trello.com/b/V5H3N3zi/where-in-the-world) for what i'd like to do in the future. if i never get around to it then oh well. if you think i should add a feature (or bug) to the board write a letter to ... my twitter. if you can't go to the trouble to find it yourself then i guess its not that big of an issue huh?
